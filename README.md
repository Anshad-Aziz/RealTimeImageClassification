Real-Time-Image-Classification-with-MobileNetV2-Deep-Learning-Detection-System
This system is an image classification tool powered by MobileNetV2, a pre-trained deep learning model. The system uses a Tkinter graphical user interface (GUI) to allow users to upload images and receive predictions on the imageâ€™s content. The predictions are based on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1,000 object categories.

Key Features:
MobileNetV2: A lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) that is ideal for mobile and embedded applications due to its low memory requirements and fast inference speed.

Image Upload: Users can upload any image via a file dialog, and the system will automatically resize and preprocess the image to make predictions.

Top Predictions: The top 3 predicted categories for the uploaded image are displayed, along with their confidence scores.

How It Works:
Model Loading: The pre-trained MobileNetV2 model is loaded with weights from the ImageNet dataset.

Image Preprocessing: Uploaded images are resized to 224x224 pixels (required by the model) and preprocessed (pixel normalization).

Prediction: The image is passed through the MobileNetV2 model, and predictions are generated for 1,000 possible categories.

Display Results: The system displays the uploaded image along with the predicted category and the confidence scores for the top 3 predictions.

Application Flow:
Tkinter GUI: Provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

File Dialog: Users can upload images from their local system.

Image Preview: Shows a preview of the uploaded image.

Predictions: Displays the top 3 categories predicted by the MobileNetV2 model, with corresponding confidence percentages.

This system is a demonstration of deep learning in real-time object recognition, and it can be adapted for various practical applications such as mobile-based classification systems or embedded AI solutions.
